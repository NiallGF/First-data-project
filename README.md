**First Project**

This file is my first data science project. The aim of this project is to measure how effectively house prices can be predicted using a regressive model, using features that are observed to have a correlation with this target variable. 

The data set used was sourced from Kaggle, and contains data regarding houses, their sale prices and their various features.

My objective is to determine the key features that contribute toward house prices, and to analyse these features. Finally, I will attempt to create a model that can predict house prices based on these features and attemopt to fine tune the model, to get as low an MSE score as possible.
