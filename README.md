**First Project**

This file is my first data science project. This project is currently a work in progress, and I will be using my skills gained at University to complete the final stakes of the project.

The data set used was sourced from Kaggle, and contains data regarding house sales.

My objective is to determine the key features that contribute toward house prices, and to analyse these features. Finally, I will attempt to create a model that can predict house prices based on these features and attemopt to fine tune the model, to get as low an MSE as possible. 

The project has been fully coded, however I am currently working on writing all the markdown to explain the steps I have taken. 

I am making regular updates to this project.
