**First Project**

This file is my first data science project. 

The data set used was sourced from Kaggle, and contains data regarding house sales.

My objective is to determine the key features that contribute toward house prices, and to analyse these features. Finally, I will attempt to create a model that can predict house prices based on these features.

This may not be the most ground breaking or innovative project, but I have used this for practise. The project has given me the oppertunity to learn the tools needed to analyse data in Python, and provided me with a base understanding of how data science projects are tackled.

This project has been done completely on my own initiative and in my spare time. I have largely used what I have learnt from LinkdIn Learning along with various internet sources and analytical skills that I have develped in my current employment. I have additionally used AI (ChatGPT) to help me plan the project and understand the order of tasks i must complete. 

If have you have any questions or advice, please dont hesitate to message me!
